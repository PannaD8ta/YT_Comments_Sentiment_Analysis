For some reason I could never get a full understanding of his codes. Somewhere I thought it was me being incapable of learning. Later I took some courses from deeplearning.ai on coursera and I started understanding some of the basics of AI and NLP and almost forgot this guy. Suddenly I find all of this..

27,"Hi Siraj, you are good at explaining things just stick to that if you can explain all hard topics on science and engineering you will  be legend, just explain anything in AI and ML and refer to any github repo as an example or implementation and on the video just credit the coder, trust you will gain  more popularity than the coder. There are lot of professor and scientist who are good at research and engineering but just cant explain things in a simple method, if you are good at explaining complex stuff  you can revolutionise the whole learning procedure so that more people can know about it. 

You can consider yourself a better version of documentary about science and engineering what documentary does not allow is knowing how to implement what you learning/knowing .

So keep it up(providing you crediting the actual author) just dont forget to credit the coder on your video .

1) Stop making ""educational"" AI/ML videos on this channel - your cred in this field is practically gone and nobody will take you seriously. The internet never forgets.
2) Make a formal apology to the Xanadu AI team and to the people who paid money for your courses. Refund everything.
3) Rebuild your internet presence into something more appropriate like a science popularizer if this is what you still wish to do. Don't pretend to know things you don't know. The internet will be VERY critical of everything you do from now on cross checking any content you put out.

What you did is wrong but it's not the end of the world. Everyone makes mistakes. You have talent as an internet personality and you can still make something out of it.

95,"This whole fallacy of ""you don't have to go to college to be successful"" needs to die. It is true, you don't need a higher education to succeed, and a lot of people for various reasons just cannot go to college. And that is ok. But the idea is way overblown. If you have the means to go to college and get an educational degree, you must do so. You can make great discoveries in AI or whatever field if you do not go to college, but a good college also teaches you how to be a good person, and if you are lucky enough to go to one, you will just have a way higher chance of succeeding and you will have way more resources if you do go to college. They never talk about the sheer back-breaking work that successful people who haven't gone to college have done, and also the sheer luck they had throughout their lives. Saying ""Bill Gates is one of the richest people ever and he didn't go to college"" is just blatant laziness and ignorance, if you have the means to go to college. Not everyone has the opportunity to get a higher education, but if you do, do not let it go to waste.


This channel boils my blood. It is rife in horrible career advice. I would say if you want to learn AI and ML, go watch videos by accredited people. It will give you a way better understanding of both the details and the big picture stuff. Id suggest especially the DeepLearning.ai channel. It will also give you valuable career advice in the form of interviews from well-known AI researchers. I would also advice you to pick up a well-reviewed book or a well-known paper. That can be daunting, but with some effort you will be working how a real researcher works.

112,"15:50 ""... my whole shtick is that you don't need to be a PhD in order to do research—in order to contribute to this field. And, I think I live that because I recently published a paper called 'A Neural Qubit', and over 30,000 people saw this paper because I have a social media following... these research papers that people publish, they don't get a lot of views—you know, these academics, they don't get a lot. Maybe like 100 views, 200...""

As someone who is wrapping up a masters degree in CS and moving on to a PhD program in January, I want to highlight a few things about this statement:

1) True, you don't need a PhD to do research. However, going through a PhD program helps you learn how to do effective/ethical research and how to include other researchers' ideas in your work (and most of all, how to *cite* them). The acquisition of the degree also serves as credential to help other researchers and laymen quickly differentiate between effective researchers and charlatans.

2) The goal of researchers is not to get as many views as possible. General fame and vanity (ideally) don't play a role in legitimate research. Researchers seek impact, not views. Impact means publishing research that eventually gets *cited* by other researchers—this means they are building upon your work and that your work has genuinely accelerated the field forward.

3) Siraj, I don't know who you're trying to fool when you imply that you contributed to this community. Even you know that you blatantly copied the work of two different research groups and ultimately failed to present anything new in that paper.

I think you may want to re-evaluate your view of the education system. Higher education is far from perfect; but with this plagiarism scandal, you just demonstrated why people *should* seek enrollment in accredited institutions (not just diploma mills) to learn and contribute to these sorts of things.",UgwuRh6pqf26D82dm794AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf50DFffcnkvFjKRBQ--R_A,Channel1019,1,17,2019-10-24 23:33:35+00:00,7uEWnFluSY8,1,Live Q&A with Siraj Raval,2019-10-24

You're following an ambitious guy who make things easy to understand through his funny videos not a math genius or physicist who can come up with a revolutionary theory every week. I'm following Siraj to get overall ideas about some subjects and learn practical tricks, and he's good at teaching these stuff, not to understand everything and build it from the bottom up. Siraj videos are one of the many free resources one can use to learn, so be smart and don't expect this guy to fill all your needs, wanna something serious check arxiv.

Why didn't you just posted a reference to the original paper instead of copying it. You also screenshot the equations and figure captions and used Word, which would NEVER been used by people in that field.
You are just after the money. A course for roughly 200$, in which you just copied the code from other people, is a good evidence for that. Everyone, who wants to learn the fundamentals of machine learning and artificial intelligence and can not attend university for that should instead buy a good book or two (e.g. ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" from Christopher Bishop).

240,"Siraj, I'm as disappointed as everybody but I also don't want to see you burnt from ML here's what I think you could do, The Full Mea Culpa':
1. Go into your Github repos and youtube videos. Completely and meticulously credit all the work you've used from other people. This could take you weeks with 300+ videos and code. But this is the first thing you should do.
2. While doing that completely refund your students. Even these students still in the course that are banking on your recommends to startups and companies. You must know these recommends are completely impacted by your recent controversies and they are one of the most important selling points for taking the course. You gotta be proactive in offering these refunds to EVERY student and recognize the investment as a loss.
3. Create an apology video. I've noticed you are responsive to criticism in the past, though you prefer the comments section/twitter. This requires a fleshed out video addressing every part of the plagiarism and course issues. You have to demonstrate complete mea culpa, being able to say you've refunded EVERYONE including the participating students. Explain how you've changed your repos and video information to include citation. Explain what you'll do moving forward with other people's work. Apologize for deliberate plagiarism, not excusing the idea that the paper was just supposed to be an educational resource (even in this video you describe it as a published research paper you produced rather than an educational example of what one could look like). Apologize by naming the authors of the original paper explicitly. And the last part may sound odd, but it gets to the heart of the issue. Apologize for your hype-intensive communication style and how your intention of getting people excited for ML was well-intentioned, but became a way of replacing excitement for the technical work of ML with false hope of speedy results that the field doesn't produce. Explain that you still want to get people excited for ML, but will stress the *honest* work it will take to produce results in the field. Explain that going forward, you will *not* claim understanding of subjects with a false confidence and produce a mix of original work and detail the work put in by others.
4. Try not to mention much vulnerability that focuses on how you've been impacted by this and instead focus on rectifying how others have been impacted. 
5. Take a long break from course content

People want to see you burnt over this, but many people were introduced to ML partly by your energy in these videos. It's definitely a sad scandal that isn't fun to watch.

278,"Dude you need to own this. The course debacle is not so good, the paper plagiarism is really really bad, and you didn't even need it! (did you ever do it any other times? Great!!! Tell everybody about them apologize and full disclosure, get ahead of it before the twitter mob finds them. That will go a long way) 

Own it! apologize, and then make less videos, but videos that actually teach difficult concepts. Many of your videos would dabble in the hard stuff, but afterwards, it was still a long hard slog to get to a real understanding. Brilliant teaching is very hard to do, but if you manage to get to a point in which you actually do what your whole schtick promised, you'll be OK. You'll have a lot less subscribers, but you'll recover. Only making that thing that your whole channel has promised will help you recover, and you will need to recover. Don't persist in bullshit, it will come back to haunt you and you will never be free of it. 

There's this company called salesforce. They are worth billions, they suck!! Their interface is like the child of VBASIC and windowsME, the reason they are so successful is because they have identified a real billion-dollar problem, namely  make apps quickly that let you embed business logic, and they have done the shittiest execution of a solution in history, but people still give them money to do that, because they know that that problem needs to be solved and whoever is working on a solution will make more progress than someone who isn't.

You have identified an equally important billion-dollar problem, namely teach the masses machine learning in a way that does not remind them of a calc3 lecture. If you can execute and actually do what you set out to do, you will generate real value and you'll be ok. What you have so far achieved with many of your videos is to create these little entertaining resting ledges on the way up the mountain, which are great, but you need to do more. 

Have a look at the old 70's era David Burke series from the BBC called 'Connections' . Many difficult concepts are understandable when seen in their historical contexts, the Alexnet --> Resnet progression can be taught in this way. It only makes sense when read as a progression, and what a progression!!! 
Good luck Siraj.  Get cleaned up and sail on back to us. The world needs you!! No seriously!!!


PS please please please don't tell me this was faked its ok if it is I just don't want to know. Please keep the dream alive for me!!
